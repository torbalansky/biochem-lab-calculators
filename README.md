# Biochem Lab Calculators

**Biochem Lab Calculators** (BioLab) is a suite of scientific calculators built to assist researchers, students, and scientists in performing essential calculations in biology and chemistry. 

The app is live at: [Biochem Lab Calculators](https://biochem-lab-calculators.vercel.app/)

## Features

This app offers a variety of calculators for lab work, including:

1. **Mass Molarity Calculator** - Quickly calculate the molarity of a solution from the mass of a substance.
2. **Dilution Calculator** - Find out how to dilute stock solutions to a desired concentration.
3. **Percent Solution Calculator** - Compute percent solutions, either weight/volume or volume/volume.
4. **Formula Weight Calculator** - Calculate the molecular weight of compounds based on their chemical formula.
5. **Beer-Lambert Law Calculator** - Calculate absorbance, concentration, or molar absorptivity based on Beer-Lambert's law.
6. **RCF to RPM Calculator** - Convert between Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF) and Revolutions Per Minute (RPM) for centrifugation.
7. **PCR Master Mix Calculator** - Compute the required volume of each reagent in a PCR reaction for a given number of reactions.
8. **Unit Conversion Tool** - Easily convert between different units.
9. **Antibody Dilution Calculator** - Easily calculate the required volume of antibody stock for Western Blot experiments based on your desired dilution factor and final volume.
10. **Protein and DNA concentration Calculators** - Determine the concentration of protein or DNA in a sample using absorbance measurements.
11. **Enzyme Activity Calculator** - Calculate the reaction rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction based on the Michaelis constant, substrate concentration, and Vmax. This tool provides the reaction rate in M/s, allowing for quick insights into enzymatic activity and efficiency at given substrate concentrations.
